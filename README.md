# Target_Sales_Analysis_SQL

## Advanced Analysis

## Project Overview

Worked on analyzing a dataset of over 100,000 sales records for an Amazon-Like (Target Sales) e-commerce platform. This
project involves extensive querying of customer behaviour, product performance and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Tackeled 
variou SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation and inventory management.

An ERD Diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## Database Setup & Design
### Schema Structure
  1. The database contains 7 tables: customers, sellers, orders, orderItems, products, geolocation and payments.
  2. These tables are designed with primary keys, foreign key constraints.
  3. You can find the SQL script for setting up the databae schema in the SQL file names - Target Sales Schema attached above.

## Solving Business Problems
### Solutions Implemented:
  1. Restock Prediction: By forecating product demandbased on past sales
  2. Product performance: Identified high return products and optimized their sales strategies such as pricing adjustments.
  3. Shipping Optimization: Analyzed shipping times and delivery providers to recommend better logistics strategies and
     improve customer satisfaction.
  4. Customer Segmentation: Conducted analysis to target marketing efforts towards "At-Risk" customers, improving rertention and
     loyalty.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL profiency through complex queries that address real world e-commerce
business challenges.The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:

  1. Customer Behaviour
  2. Sales Trends
  3. Inventory Management
  4. Payments and shipping analysis
  5. Product performance

## Learning Outcomes

This project enabled me to:

 1. Design and implement a database schema from scratch.
 2. Clean and preprocessnreal-world datasets for analysis.
 3. Use advanced SQL techniques including window functions, sub queries and joins.
 4. Conduct in depth analysis using SQL.
 5. Handle large datasets.
